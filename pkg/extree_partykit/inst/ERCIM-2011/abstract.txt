Title: partykit: A toolkit for recursive partytioning
Authors: Achim Zeileis, Torsten Hothorn

Recursive partitioning methods, or simply "trees", are simple yet powerful
methods for capturing regression relationships. Hence, many different algorithms
have been suggested in both the statistics and machine learning communities and
many standard algorithms are available as R packages, e.g., in rpart, RWeka,
party, and many others. However, no common infrastructure is available for
representing trees fitted by different packages. Consequently, the capabilities
for extraction of information - such as predictions, printed summaries, or
visualizations - vary between packages and come with somewhat different user
interfaces. Similarly, implementations of new tree models might also require new
infrastructure, e.g., for multi-way splits or more complex models in the leafs.
To overcome these difficulties, the partykit package offers a unified
representation of tree objects along with predict(), print(), and plot()
methods. Trees are represented through a new flexible class "party" which can,
in principle, capture all trees mentioned above. The package is currently under
development at R-Forge and already provides conversion methods for trees of
classes rpart, J48, and pmmlTreeModel as well as a re-implementation of
conditional inference trees. Furthermore, the new packages evtree and CHAID
employ the partykit infrastructure.
