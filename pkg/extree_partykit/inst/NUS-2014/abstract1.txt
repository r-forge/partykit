Constant Partying: Introducing a Generic Toolkit for Recursive Partitioning in R

Torsten Hothorn (Universität Zürich), Achim Zeileis (Universität Innsbruck)

Recursive partitioning methods, or simply "trees", are simple yet powerful
methods for capturing regression relationships. Hence, many different algorithms
have been suggested in both the statistics and machine learning communities and
many standard algorithms are available as R packages, e.g., in rpart, RWeka,
party, and many others. However, no common infrastructure is available for
representing trees fitted by different packages. Consequently, the capabilities
for extraction of information - such as predictions, printed summaries, or
visualizations - vary between packages and come with somewhat different user
interfaces. Similarly, implementations of new tree models might also require new
infrastructure, e.g., for multi-way splits or more complex models in the leafs.
To overcome these difficulties, the partykit package offers a unified
representation of tree objects along with predict(), print(), and plot()
methods. Trees are represented through a new flexible class "party" which can,
in principle, capture all trees mentioned above. Moreover, a flexible subclass
"constparty" is provided for recursive partitions with constant fits (e.g.,
means or proportions) in the terminal nodes. This greatly facilitates the
representation of different types of trees in a common framework, e.g., trees
learned by rpart, J48, evtree, or chaid, or read from an XML specification in
the predictive modeling markup language PMML.
