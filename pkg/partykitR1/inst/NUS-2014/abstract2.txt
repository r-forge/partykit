Parties, Models, Mobsters: A New Implementation of Model-Based Recursive
Partitioning in R

Achim Zeileis (Universität Innsbruck), Torsten Hothorn (Universität Zürich)

MOB is a generic algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis,
Hothorn, Hornik 2008). Rather than fitting one global model to a dataset, it
estimates local models on subsets of data that are "learned" by recursively
partitioning. It proceeds in the following way: (1) fit a parametric model to a
data set, (2) test for parameter instability over a set of partitioning
variables, (3) if there is some overall parameter instability, split the model
with respect to the variable associated with the highest instability, (4) repeat
the procedure in each of the child nodes. It is discussed how these steps of the
conceptual algorithm are translated into computational tools in an
object-oriented manner, allowing the user to plug in various types of parametric
models. For representing the resulting trees, the R package "partykit" is
employed: The basic "party" class is leveraged and extended to a new class
"modelparty" providing generic infrastructure for recursive partitions where
nodes are associated with statistical models. Compared to the previously
available implementation in the party package, the new implementation supports
more inference options, is easier to extend to new models, and provides more
convenience features.
