Description: Recursive partitioning based on (generalized) linear mixed models
    (GLMMs) combining lmer()/glmer() from 'lme4' and lmtree()/glmtree() from 
    'partykit'. The fitting algorithm is described in more detail in Fokkema,
    Smits, Zeileis, Hothorn & Kelderman (2018; <DOI:10.3758/s13428-017-0971-x>).
    For detecting and modeling subgroups in growth curves with GLMM trees see
    Fokkema & Zeileis (2024; <DOI:10.3758/s13428-024-02389-1>).
