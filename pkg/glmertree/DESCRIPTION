Description: Recursive partitioning based on (generalized) linear mixed models
    (GLMMs) combining lmer()/glmer() from 'lme4' and lmtree()/glmtree() from 
    'partykit'. The fitting algorithm is described in more detail in Fokkema,
    Smits, Zeileis, Hothorn & Kelderman (2018; <DOI:10.3758/s13428-017-0971-x>).
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), lme4, partykit (>= 1.0-4)
Imports: graphics, stats, utils, Formula
