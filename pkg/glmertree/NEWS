Changes in Version 0.1-2

  o Functions glmertree() and lmertree() now take offset arguments.
  
  o Argument ranefstart of functions glmertree() and lmertree() can now be 
    set to TRUE. As a result, the random effects will be estimated
    before fitting the tree in the first iteration. This may yield better 
    results when random effects are expected to be substantial.

  o Functions glmertree() and lmertree() now take cluster argument, an optional 
    vector with cluster IDs to be employed for clustered covariances in the parameter 
    stability tests.

  o Bugs fixed: Argument dfsplit is now passed correctly to tree fitting functions,
    additional arguments are now passed correctly to (g)lmer().	.

  o Arguments "lmer.control" in lmertree() and "glmer.control" in glmertree()
    are now actually passed to lmer() and glmer() internally.

  o First CRAN release of the "glmertree" package for fitting generalized linear
    mixed-effects model trees in R. For an introduction to the underlying methods see

    Treatment-Subgroup Interactions in Clustered Data with Generalized
    Linear Mixed-Effects Model Trees. Working Paper 2015-10. Working Papers
