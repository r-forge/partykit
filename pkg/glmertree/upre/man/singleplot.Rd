\title{Create partial dependence plot for a single variable}
\usage{
singleplot(object, varname, penalty.par.val = "lambda.min", nvals = NULL,
  type = "response")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{\link{upre}}}

\item{varname}{character vector of length one, specifying the variable for 
which the partial dependence plot should be created.}

\item{penalty.par.val}{character. Should model be selected with lambda giving 
minimum cv error ("lambda.min"),}

\item{nvals}{optional numeric vector of length one. For how many values of x 
should the partial dependence plot be created?}

\item{type}{character string. Type of prediction to be plotted on y-axis. 
\code{type = "response"} gives fitted values for continuous outputs and 
fitted probabilities for nominal outputs. \code{type = "link"} gives fitted
values for continuous outputs and linear predictor values for nominal outputs.}
}
\description{
\code{singleplot} creates a partial dependence plot, which shows the effect of 
a predictor variable on the ensemble's predictions
}
\details{
By default, a partial dependence plot will be created for each unique 
observed value of the specified predictor variable. When the number of unique 
observed values is large, this may take a long time to compute. In that case, 
specifying the nvals argument can substantially reduce computing time. When the 
nvals argument is supplied, values for the minimum, maximum, and (nvals - 2) 
intermediate values of the predictor variable will be plotted. Note that nvals
can be specified only for numeric and ordered input variables. If the plot is
requested for a nominal input variable, the \code{nvals} argument will be 
ignored and a warning is printed.
