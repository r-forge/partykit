 problematic because of lack of clear definition of beta and gamma change and/or methods to assess such
 change. The present paper applies an analysis of covariance structures to this problem using pre and post
 employment responses to a questionnaire assessing human needs. An analysis of data transformed in a manner
 consistent with theoretical definitions of beta change indicated the presence of such change and further
 supported the use of the procedure.}
