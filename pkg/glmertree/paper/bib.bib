 A principal components analysis with an oblimin and varimax rotation produced a two-factor solution. These factors were labeled Cognitive-Affective
 and Physiological and accounted for approximately 39% of the common variance. This finding is consistent with multidimensionality of the inventory
 and with a similar study of college students. The commonalities of the two studies suggest the reliability (internal consistency) of the
 Cognitive-Affective and Physiological constructs among "minimally" depressed university samples.}

 problematic because of lack of clear definition of beta and gamma change and/or methods to assess such
 change. The present paper applies an analysis of covariance structures to this problem using pre and post
 employment responses to a questionnaire assessing human needs. An analysis of data transformed in a manner
 consistent with theoretical definitions of beta change indicated the presence of such change and further
 supported the use of the procedure.}

  Abstract                 = {The revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 1,290 intravenous (IV) drug users who were not
 currently enrolled in a treatment program. A principalcomponents analysis indicated that the cognitive-affective
 and somatic-performance components found in psychiatric patients were also present in IV drug users, and subscales
 based on the compositions of these 2 components were derived. The correlations of the BDI total and 2 subscale scores
 with 25 of the IV drug users' background characteristics were calculated, and stepwise multiple regression analyses
 were used to identify the most meaningful correlates. Self-reported poor health was the most important correlate.
 The usefulness of the BDI for measuring self-reported depression in IV drug users who are not in treatment is discussed.}
