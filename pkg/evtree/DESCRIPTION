Description: Commonly used classification and regression tree methods like the CART algorithm are recursive methods that build the model in a forward stepwise search. Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. This package implements an evolutionary algorithm to build classification and regression trees in R.
