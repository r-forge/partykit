* Bug fix in prediction with new observations.


# palmtree 0.9-0

* Initial release of the _palmtree_ package for partially additive (generalized)
  linear model trees. The estimation uses an EM-type algorithm similar to
  _glmertree_.
  
* Details of the algorithm are described in: Heidi Seibold, Torsten Hothorn,
  Achim Zeileis (2016). "Generalised Linear Model Trees with Global Additive
  Effects." [arXiv:1612.07498](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07498),
