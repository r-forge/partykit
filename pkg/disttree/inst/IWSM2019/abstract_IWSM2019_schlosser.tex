\abstract{
For probabilistic modeling of circular data the von Mises distribution is widely used.
To capture how its parameters change with covariates, a regression tree model
is proposed as an alternative to more commonly-used additive models. The resulting
distributional trees are easy to interpret, can detect non-additive effects, and select
covariates and their interactions automatically. For illustration, hourly wind 
direction forecasts are obtained at Innsbruck Airport based on a set of meteorological
measurements.

%\section{Motivation}
%Circular response variables occur in a variety of applications and subject areas. 
%For example, gun crime data on a $24$-hour scale is analysed in the social-economics, 
%animal orientation or gene-structure analysis are often subject of examination in biology, 
%and wind direction is one of the most important weather variables in meteorology.
%Representing such a two-dimensional direction by an angle in a unity circle requires 
%the specification of a starting point (angle 0) and either a clockwise or anti-clockwise 
%rotation. However, these settings can vary but should not influence statistical 
%inference from a fitted model.
%For that reason circular data demand for purpose-built statistical methods. 
%A commonly chosen distribution for modeling circular data is the von Mises distribution.
%Estimating its two distribution parameters by generalized additive models using a set of 
%regressor variables is one possible approach that can be successful in various settings.
%As an alternative we propose the application of distributional trees 
%which are capable of detecting also non-additive effects and provide easily interpretable 
%models allowing for a wide range of inference procedures.
%Moreover, covariates and their possible interactions are selected automatically
%such that no expert knowledge is required to specify the model in advance.

\section{Methodology}

Distributional trees~(Schlosser et.~al, 2018) fuse distributional regression modeling with
regression trees based on the unbiased recursive partitioning algorithms MOB~(Zeileis et.~al, 2008)
or CTree~(Hothorn et.~al, 2006). The basic idea is to partition the covariate space recursively into 
subgroups such that an (approximately) homogeneous distributional model can be fitted to the response 
in each resulting subgroup.
To capture dependence on covariates, the association between the model's scores and each available
covariate is assessed using either a parameter instability test (MOB) or a permutation test (CTree).
In each partitioning step, the covariate with the highest significant association (i.e., lowest
significant $p$-value, if any) is selected for splitting the data. The corresponding split point
is chosen either by optimizing the log-likelihood (MOB) or a two-sample test statistic (CTree)
over all possible partitions.

In this study distributional trees are adapted to circular responses by employing the von Mises
distribution, also known as ``the circular normal distribution''. Based on a location parameter
$\mu \in [-\pi, \pi]$ and a concentration parameter $\kappa > 0$ the density for $y \in [-\pi, \pi]$
is given by:
\begin{equation}
  f_\mathrm{vM}(y; \mu, \kappa) = \frac{1}{2 \pi I_0(\kappa)}~e^{ \kappa \cos(y - \mu)}\label{schlosser:equ_vm}
\end{equation}
where $I_0(\kappa)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and order $0$
(see, e.g., Jammalamadaka and Sengupta (2001) for a more detailed overview).

In each subgroup maximum likelihood estimators $\hat \mu$ and $\hat \kappa$ are obtained
by maximizing the corresponding log-likelihood $\ell(\mu, \kappa; y) = \log(f_\mathrm{vM}(y;\mu, \kappa))$. 
The model scores are given by  $s(y; \mu, \kappa) = (\partial_{\mu} \ell(\mu, \kappa; y),
\partial_{\kappa} \ell(\mu, \kappa; y))$. In a subgroup of size $n$, evaluating the scores
at the individual observations and parameter estimates $s(y_i; \hat{\mu}, \hat{\kappa})$
yields an $n \times 2$ matrix that can be employed as a kind of residual, capturing how well
a given observation conforms with the estimated location $\hat{\mu}$ and precision $\hat{\kappa}$, 
respectively.
Hence MOB or CTree can assess whether the scores change along with the available covariates.
If so, by maximizing a partitioned likelihood
the parameter instabilities are incorporated into the model. This procedure is repeated recursively
until there are no significant parameter instabilities or until another stopping criterion
is met (e.g., subgroup size or tree depth).


\section{Application}

\begin{figure}[p!]\centering

\caption{Fitted tree based on the von Mises distribution for wind direction forecasting.
In each terminal node the empirical histogram (gray) and fitted density (red line)
are depicted along with the estimated location parameter (red hand). The covariates
employed are wind direction ($\text{rad}$), wind speed ($\text{ms}^{-1}$),
and pressure gradients ($\text{hPa}$) west and east of the airport,
all lagged by one hour.}
\label{schlosser:fig_tree} \end{figure}

Wind is a classical circular quantity and accurate forecasts of wind direction
are of great importance for decision-making processes and risk management,
e.g., in air traffic management or renewable energy production. This study
employs circular regression trees to obtain hourly wind direction
forecasts at Innsbruck Airport.
Innsbruck lies at the bottom of a deep valley in the Alps. Topography
channels wind along the west-east valley axis or along a tributary valley
intersecting from the south. Hence, pressure gradients to which valley wind
regimes react both west and east of the airport are considered as covariates
along with other meteorological measurements at the airport (lagged by one hour),
such as wind direction and wind speed at Innsbruck Airport.

Figure~\ref{schlosser:fig_tree} depicts the resulting distributional tree, including
both the empirical (gray) and fitted von Mises (red) distribution of wind direction
in each terminal node. Based on the fitted location parameters $\hat \mu$, the subgroups
can be distinguished into the following wind regimes:
(1)~Up-valley winds blowing from the valley mouth towards the upper valley
(from east to west, nodes 4 and 5). (2) Downslope winds blowing across
the Alpine crest along the Wipp Valley towards Innsbruck (from south-east to
north-west, nodes 7 and 8). (3) Down-valley winds blowing in the direction
of the valley mouth (from west to east, nodes 12, 14, and 15). Node~11
captures observations with rather low wind speeds that cannot be distinguished
clearly into wind regimes and consequently are associated with a very low
estimated concentration $\hat \kappa$. In terms of covariates, the lagged
wind direction (``persistence'') is mostly responsible for distinguishing
the broad wind regimes listed above while the pressure gradients and wind
speed separate between subgroups with high vs.\ low precision.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}

Distributional trees for circular responses are established by coupling
model-based recursive partitioning with the von Mises distribution.
The resulting trees can capture nonlinear changes, shifts, and potential interactions
in covariates without prespecification of such effects. This is particularly
useful for modeling wind direction in mountainous terrain where wind shifts
can occur due to turns of the pressure gradients along a valley.

A natural extension are ensembles (or forests) of such circular trees
that can improve forecasts by regularizing and stabilizing the model
(see Schlosser et.~al~(2018) for a general discussion of distributional forests). 

Another possible improvement for obtaining more parsimonious and more stable trees is to
consider splitting circular covariates into two circle segments by searching two
split points simultaneously (rather than sequentially at different depths as
for the lagged wind direction in Figure~\ref{schlosser:fig_tree}).

\textsf{R} packages implementing the proposed methods are under development at
