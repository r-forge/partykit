\section{Changes in Version 1.0-0 (2015-02-20}{
  \itemize{
    \item{Version 1.0-0 published. This version is described in the MLOSS paper 
          accepted for publication by the Journal of Machine Learning Research today.}
    \item{The unbiased version of \code{cforest} (with \code{replace = FALSE}) is 
          now the default (as in \pkg{party}).}
    \item{Register all S3 methods in \code{NAMESPACE}.}
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.8-4 (2015-01-06}{
  \itemize{
    \item{Extended \code{mob()} interface by a \code{cluster} argument. This can be
    a vector (numeric, integer, factor) with cluster IDs that are
    then passed on to the 'fit' function (if supported) and used
    for clustering the covariance matrix in the parameter stability
    tests. \code{lmtree()} and \code{glmtree()} hence both gained a \code{cluster}
    argument which is used only for cluster covariances but not
    for the model estimation (i.e., corresponding to a working
    independence model).}

    \item{Optionally, the parameters' variance-covariance matrix in \code{mob()}
    can now be estimated by the sandwich matrix instead of the default
    outer-product-of-gradients (OPG) matrix or the information matrix.}

    \item{Reimplementation of \code{cforest()} available with extended 
    prediction facilities. Both the internal representation and the user interface
    are still under development are likely to change in future versions.}
    
    \item{Added multicore support to \code{mob()}, \code{ctree()}, and \code{cforest()}.
    If control argument \code{cores} is specified (e.g., \code{cores = 4}) then the
    search for the best variable or split point (often involving numerous model fits in
    \code{mob()} or resampling in \code{ctree()}) is carried out using \code{parallel::mclapply()}
    rathern than sequential \code{for()} or \code{sapply()}. Additionally, other
    \code{applyfun}s can be provided, e.g., using networks of workstations etc.}

    \item{Bug fix in \code{mob()} that occurred when regressor variables and
    partitioning variables overlapped and were not sorted in the
    underlying model frame.}
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.8-3 (2014-12-15}{
  \itemize{
    \item{\pkg{mvpart} was archived 2014-12-15.}
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.8-2 (2014-09-12)}{
  \itemize{
    \item{Fixed an uninitialized memory issue reported by valgrind.}
  }
}

\section{Changes in Version 0.8-1 (2014-09-08)}{
  \itemize{

  \item{partykit now depends on R version >= 3.1.0 in order to import the
        \code{depth()} generic from the \pkg{grid} package.}

  \item{The print methods for \code{party}/\code{partynode} objects with only a root node
    was modified. Now, the terminal panel function is also applied
    if there is only a root node (while previously it was not).}

  \item{ \code{ctree()} now catches \code{sum(weights) <= 1} situations before they 
    lead to an error.}

  \item{ Code from suggested packages is included by using \code{::} syntax as
    required by recent R versions.}
    
  \item{ Argument \code{ytrafo} of \code{ctree()} can now be a function which will be
    updated in every node.}
    
  \item{ A small demo briefly illustrating some memory and speed properties
    has been added. It can be run interactively via
    \code{demo("memory-speed", package = "partykit").}}
    
  \item{ Section 3 of the "constparty" vignette now shows how properties of
    a new tree algorithm can be assessed by using \pkg{partykit} building
    blocks.}
  }
}


\section{Changes in Version 0.8-0 (2014-03-27)}{
  \itemize{

  \item{Major improved version of \pkg{partykit}. The previously existing functions
    in the package were tested and enhanced, new functions and
    extensive vignettes added.}

  \item{Extended and improved introductory documentation. The basic classes
    and class constructors \code{partynode}/\code{partysplit}/\code{party} are introduced in 
    much more detail now in \code{vignette("partykit", package = "partykit")}.}
    
  \item{The class \code{constparty} (inheriting from \code{party}) for representing \code{party}
    objects with constant fits in the nodes (along with coercion methods
    for \code{rpart}, \code{J48}, etc.) is now described in more detail in the new
    \code{vignette("constparty", package = "partykit")}.}

  \item{The package now includes a reimplementation of the model-based
    recursive partitioning algorithm (MOB) using \pkg{partykit} infrastructure.
    The generic algorithm, the corresponding convenience interfaces
    \code{lmtree()} and \code{glmtree()} as well as various illustrations and possible
    extensions are described in detail in the new
    \code{vignette("mob", package = "partykit")}.}

  \item{Improved implementation of conditional inference trees (CTree), see
    the new \code{vignette("ctree", package = "partykit")} for details.}

  \item{New \code{nodeprune()} generic for pruning nodes in all \code{party} trees and
    \code{partynode} objects.}

  \item{Deal with empty levels in \code{ctree()} for \code{teststat = "quad"}
    (bug reported by Wei-Yin Loh <loh_at_stat.wisc.edu>).}

  \item{In \code{predict()} method for \code{constparty} objects, \code{type = "prob"} now returns
    ECDF for numeric responses and \code{type = "response"} the (weighted) mean.}

  \item{New panel function \code{node_ecdf()} for plotting empirical cumulative
    distribution functions in the terminal leaves of \code{constparty} trees.}

\section{Changes in Version 0.1-3 (2012-01-11)}{
  \itemize{

  \item{Added \pkg{ipred} to the list of suggested packages due to usage of

  }
}


\section{Changes in Version 0.1-2 (2011-12-18)}{
