Dear Drs. Murphy and Sch√∂lkopf,

my co-author Achim Zeileis and I would like to submit the manuscript
``partykit: An Open-Source Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning in R'' to the
Machine Learning Open-Source Software track of the Journal of Machine
Learning Research.

The R add-on package partykit described in this submission implements a
flexible toolkit for learning, representing, summarizing, and visualizing a
wide range of tree-structured models.  The package offers a basic class
infrastructure for representing fitted trees, a unified set of methods for
printing and plotting of trees as well as for computing predictions for new
observations, tailored functionality for trees with constant fits and with
parametric models in each terminal node, and re-implemtations of conditional
inference trees (CTree) and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB).

This manuscript is related to JMLR-07-240-1 ``Let's Have a party! An
Open-Source Toolbox for Recursive Partytioning'' describing the party add-on
package.  This manuscript was rejected with encouragment for resubmission by
JMLR-MLOSS editor Cheng Soon Ong in November 2007.  The development of the
new package partykit was partially motivated by the reviews we received for
JMLR-07-240-1.  The partykit package in its current form goes well beyond
what was suggested at that time.  We therefore think it is appropriate to
treat this manuscript as a new submission rather than a resubmission of
JMLR-07-240-1.

Sincerely yours,
