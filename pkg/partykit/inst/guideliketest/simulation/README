The Power of Unbiased Recursive Partitioning: A Unifying View of CTree, MOB, and GUIDE (2019)

The simulation results can be reproduced by the function calls in the file 
simulation.R

The corresponding figures can be reproduced by the function calls in the file
figures.R

The already calculated simulation results are provided in the folder 'results'
containing three rda-files:
sim_stump.rda
sim_3way.rda
sim_tree.rda

If results should not be recalculated for producing figures, the .rda files need
to be exported from the folder 'results' to the main folder 'simulation', otherwise the results are recalculated when executing figure.R.

Functions applied in the simulation are provided in the source files 
tests_guideprune.R
guidelike.R
ccprune.R

The file tests_guideprune.R contains the data generating proceses and the evaluation functions providing the general framework to apply all tests considered in the study and obtain results already prepared for illustration.

The file guidelike.R contains the testing functions, i.e., the modifications of CTree and MOB and the reimplementation of GUIDE also allowing for modifications.

The file ccrune.R contains the reimplementation of cost-complexity pruning.

The partykit package is applied under a development version (based on version 1.2-4) which provides M-fluctuation-tests that are not available in version 1.2.4 as currently available on CRAN. Therefore, the applied development version is provided in the folder 'simulation' named partykit_1.2-4.2.tar.gz.

Computation time for full reproduction of results (on our machines, using 3 kernels): approximately 21h + 20min + ..h 
started 17:16
