Changes in Version 0.8-0

  o Major improved version of "partykit". The previously existing functions
    in the package were tested and enhanced, new functions and
    extensive vignettes added.

  o Extended and improved introductory documentation. The basic classes
    and class constructors partynode/partysplit/party are introduced in 
    much more detail now in vignette("partykit", package = "partykit").
    
  o The class constparty (inheriting from party) for representing party
    objects with constant fits in the nodes (along with coercion methods
    for rpart, J48, etc.) is now described in more detail in the new
    vignette("constparty", package = "partykit").

  o The package now includes a reimplementation of the model-based
    recursive partitioning algorithm (MOB) using "partykit" infrastructure.
    The generic algorithm, the corresponding convenience interfaces
    lmtree() and glmtree() as well as various illustrations and possible
    extensions are described in detail in the new
    vignette("mob", package = "partykit").

  o Improved implementation of conditional inference trees (CTree), see
    the new vignette("ctree", package = "partykit") for details.

  o New nodeprune() generic for pruning nodes in all "party" trees and
    "partynode" objects.
