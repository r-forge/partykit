Changes in Version 0.8-0

  o Reimplementation of the model-based recursive partitioning algorithm
    (MOB) using "partykit" infrastructure. The generic algorithm and the
    corresponding convenience interfaces lmtree() and glmtree() are
    described in detail in vignette("mob", package = "partykit").

  o Improved implementation of conditional inference trees (CTree), see
    vignette("ctree", package = "partykit") for details.

  o Extended and improved introductory documentation. The basic classes
    and class constructors partynode/partysplit/party are introduced in 
    vignette("partykit", package = "partykit"). The class constparty
    (inheriting from party) for representing party objects with constant
    fits in the nodes (along with coercion methods for rpart, J48, etc.)
    is now described in more detail in vignette("constparty", package =
    "partykit").

  o New nodeprune() generic along with methods for "party" and "partynode"
    objects.
