Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing,
  summarizing, and visualizing tree-structured regression and
  classification models. This unified infrastructure can be
  used for reading/coercing tree models from different sources
  (rpart, RWeka, PMML) yielding objects that share functionality for
  print/plot/predict methods. Furthermore, re-implementations of
  ctree() and mob() from the party package are provided based
  on the new infrastructure.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.0), graphics, grid
Imports: stats, survival
Suggests: XML, pmml, rJava, rpart, mvtnorm, Formula, sandwich, 
  strucchange, vcd, AER, mlbench, TH.data (>= 1.0-3), coin, 
  RWeka (>= 0.4-19), mvpart, datasets
