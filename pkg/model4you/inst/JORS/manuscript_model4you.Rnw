\section*{Abstract}

\textcolor{blue}{A short (ca. 100 word) summary of the software being described: what problem the software addresses, how it was implemented and architected, where it is stored, and its reuse potential.}

\section*{Keywords}

personalised medicine; subgroup analysis; model-based recursive partitioning; unbiased trees;
treatment effect; random forest


\section*{Introduction}

\textcolor{blue}{An overview of the software, how it was produced, and the research for which it has been used, including references to relevant research articles. A short comparison with software which implements similar functionality should be included in this section. }



\section*{Implementation and architecture}

Based on partykit, merely convenience interface.

\textcolor{blue}{How the software was implemented, with details of the architecture where relevant. Use of relevant diagrams is appropriate. Please also describe any variants and associated implementation differences.}



\section*{Quality control}

Tests, code in this manual, examples in documentation

\textcolor{blue}{Detail the level of testing that has been carried out on the code (e.g. unit, functional, load etc.), and in which environments. If not already included in the software documentation, provide details of how a user could quickly understand if the software is working (e.g. providing examples of running the software with sample input and output data). }

\section*{(2) Availability}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section*{Operating system}

Should work on all operating systems that run R.
\textcolor{blue}{Please include minimum version compatibility.}

\section*{Programming language}
R (version 3.1.0 or higher)

\section*{Additional system requirements}
None.
\textcolor{blue}{E.g. memory, disk space, processor, input devices, output devices.}

\section*{Dependencies}
R, partykit package (version 1.2 or higher)

\section*{List of contributors}
Same as the authors:
Heidi Seibold, Achim Zeileis and Torsten Hothorn

\section*{(3) Reuse potential}

The software is intentionally written to make usage as simple as possible. We hope that researchers use it for analysis of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Clinical trials
  \item A-B testing
  \item Other situations where the comparison of two decisions is of interest
\end{itemize}
We encourage users to use the partykit forum on R-forge
(\url{https://r-forge.r-project.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=852}) or the party
tag on Stackoverflow (\url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/party}) in
case of questions or problems.

\textcolor{blue}{Please describe in as much detail as possible the ways in which the software could be reused by other researchers both within and outside of your field. This should include the use cases for the software, and also details of how the software might be modified or extended (including how contributors should contact you) if appropriate. Also you must include details of what support mechanisms are in place for this software (even if there is no support).}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textcolor{blue}{Please add any relevant acknowledgements to anyone else who supported the project in which the software was created, but did not work directly on the software itself.}


\section*{Funding statement}
Heidi Seibold and Torsten Hothorn were financially supported by the Swiss
National Science Foundation (grant 205321\_163456).

\textcolor{blue}{If the software resulted from funded research please give the funder and grant number.}



\section*{Competing interests}

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
