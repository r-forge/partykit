\title{Variable Importance for pmforest}
\usage{
\method{varimp}{pmforest}(object, nperm = 1L, OOB = TRUE,
  risk = function(x, ...) -objfun(x, sum = TRUE, ...),
  conditional = FALSE, threshold = 0.2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{DESCRIPTION.}

\item{nperm}{the number of permutations performed.}

\item{OOB}{a logical determining whether the importance is computed from the 
out-of-bag sample or the learning sample (not suggested).}

\item{risk}{the risk to be evaluated. By default the objective function 
(e.g. log-Likelihood) is used.}

\item{conditional}{a logical determining whether unconditional or conditional 
computation of the importance is performed.}

\item{threshold}{the value of the test statistic or 1 - p-value of the 
association between the variable of interest and a covariate that must be 
exceeded inorder to include the covariate in the conditioning scheme for the 
variable of interest (only relevant if conditional = TRUE).}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{\link{objfun}}.}
}
\value{
A vector of 'mean decrease in accuracy' importance scores.
}
\description{
