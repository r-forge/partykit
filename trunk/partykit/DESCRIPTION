Package: partykit
Title: A Toolkit for Recursive Partytioning
Date: 2008-09-30
Version: 0.0-1
Author: Torsten Hothorn, Achim Zeileis
Maintainer: Torsten Hothorn <Torsten.Hothorn@R-project.org>
Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing,
  summarizing, and visualizing tree-structured regression and
  classification models. This unified infrastructure can be
  used for reading/coercing tree models from different sources
  (rpart, RWeka, PMML) yielding objects that share functionality for
  print/plot/predict methods. (It will also be the basis for
  a re-implementation of the party package. Currently, only
  a re-implementation of ctree() is contained in the package.)
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), graphics, stats, grid, mvtnorm
Imports: survival
Suggests: XML, pmml, rpart, RWeka, mlbench
LazyLoad: yes
LazyData: yes
