in file guide.R.

guide depends on library(partykit)



guide
=====================

guide(formula, data, vartype = NULL, complexity, subset, weights, na.action = na.omit,
			control = guide_control())


formula:
---------------------
a formula, as in the lm function; only main effects are allowed 


data:
----------------------
an optional data frame in which to interpret the variables named in the
formula


vartype:
--------------
character vector whose length equals number of predictors in formula, 
each entry one of "n", "f", "s", "c" [cf. Loh (2002) p.371],
specifying if corresponding predictor in formula is either numeric and
"n" --> used for splitting nodes and fitting the model 
"s" --> splitting only, not fitting 
"f" --> fitting only, not splitting
or if predictor is a factor
"c" --> split nodes only, not fitting

If vartype is NULL its entries are set to "c" for factorial regressors and "n" for numeric ones. 
This setting for vartype is mandatory if complexity is "const".


complexity:
--------------
character vector who specifies the complexity of the linear model fitted at each node:
"const" --> a constant model is fitted at each node; default
"mult" --> a multiple linear model is fitted at each node; all "n" and "f" variables are used as regressors
"simple" --> a best simple linear model is fitted at each node; each "n" and "f" variable is evaluated as regressor

If complexity is "const", the entries of vartype have to be "c" for factorial regressors 
and "n" for numeric ones (which is the default behavior when vartype=NULL).


subset:
------------
optional vector saying that only a subset of the rows of the data
should be used in the fit


weights:
---------------------
optional case weights to be used in the fitting process


na.action:
--------------------
The default action na.omit deletes all observations for which response and/or predictors are missing



guide_control
=================

guide_control( splitmethod = "G", minsplit = 20)

options that control details of the guide algorithm


splitmethod:
----------------
character vector, either "G" or "M". Determines how a node is split if the selected split variable is numeric:
"G" --> uses greedy search to find the splitvalue that minimizes the total SSE in the regression models 
        fitted to the data subsets defined by the split; default
"M" --> splits at the sample median of the split variable


minsplit:
--------------
number of observations in splitted response at which no further split is desired
